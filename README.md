# Car Simulator

This repo is just practice for modelling cars with physical effects. Refer to [this paper](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-vehicle-models/-/blob/master/vehicleModels_commonRoad.pdf)
for the mystical math.

To run the simulator, just clone the repo and run `cargo run -r`. This will run the simulator with the default parameters in release mode. At the moment, the simulator can run at 60fps on my machine
with 10000 iterations per frame.
